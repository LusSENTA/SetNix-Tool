# SetNix Tool

The SetNix Tool is a script used for setting up Debian/Ubuntu based Linux distos, running xfce 4.

## Note

The SetNix Tool is not for Installing a Linux disto, but instead for Downloading/Configuring software (Example: Xfce4 configuration, Icon packs, Themes, etc) and downloading additional content (Example: Background images)
